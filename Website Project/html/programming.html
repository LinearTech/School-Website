			<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
			<section>
				<p>When it comes to programming, nothing is more important than choosing a programming language. While there are too many to talk about in detail, we have decided to pick four of the most widely recognized programming languages; C++, Python, HTML, and Javascript.</p>
				<hr>
					<article>
						<h2>C++</h2>
							<p>Created in 1985, C++ is by far one of the most widely recognised programming languages. C++ was made by Danish Computer Scientist Bjarne Stroustrup when trying to make a better version of C. which was originally was called "C with Classes". The name C++ was later created from the combination of C and the <code>++</code> increment operater. This new version of C included classes, virtual functions, constants, and the new function notation written <code>//like this.</code></p>

						<h2>Python</h2>
							<p>Made by Guido van Rossum in the 1980's, Python was made to be the successor to the ABC programming language. Similar to Java, it runs on a class based system, but it doesn't use curly brackets or semi-colons (but they are allowed). This language was designed to be picked up with relative ease, and is by far one of the most recognizable languages to date.</p>

						<h2>HTML</h2>
							<p>In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, a contracted physicist at <abbr title=" European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</abbr>, proposed ENQUIRE, the first prototype of what we know as <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. HTML is a web based markup language that is used to make creative and complex website, while still allowing people to pick it up easily. As a matter of fact, <a href="https://github.com/LTCodes5030/School-Website" alt="Github">this site</a>, in conjuction with CSS, is made with HTML.</p>

						<h2>JavaScript</h2>
							<p>Reverse engineered out of Mosaic's web browser, JavaScript, or JS, was released in 1995 by Microsoft, which allowed for Java like code to be executed flawlessly in the browser. Because it takes after Java, it has a class based system that allows for classes to be made and reused. </p>

						<h2>CSS Demo</h2>
							<p>Edit the section below to mess with the pages' CSS.</p>
<style id="code" contenteditable style="display:block; white-space: pre; width: 400px; height: 150px; overflow:scroll; padding-left:5px;">p
{
	color:black;
}
</style>
